![banner logo saying hello](http://lesleyhogg.com/img/github-banner.png)
I am a self-taught software engineer who previously worked in IT as a business systems analyst. In my day to day I work in the JavaScript universe (ES6+, React, Redux, Redux Sagas, Styled Components, Storybook, and libraries like Immutable.js, Lodash, and i18next), SQL (MYSQL and PostgreSQL), and have recently started to work with GraphQL. Previously, I worked with Ruby (Rails and Sinatra). Also, we can't forget HTML (HAML, Slim) and CSS (flex, grid)!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: React projects all day, every day (though starting to get into GraphQL)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: GraphQL, Python, JavaScript (like with music there's always ways to improve!)
