I am a self-taught software engineer who previously worked in IT as a business systems analyst. In my day to day I work in the JavaScript universe (ES6+, React, Redux, Redux Sagas, Styled Components, Storybook, and libraries like Immutable.js, Lodash, and i18next), SQL (MYSQL and PostgreSQL), and have recently started to work with GraphQL. Previously, I worked with Ruby (Rails and Sinatra). Also, we can't forget HTML (HAML, Slim) and CSS (flex, grid)!
